# Astroviewer
Small example app to showcase my Android dev skills.

Astroviewer allows you to view pictures that the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) web service provides. *Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer*, as they say.
