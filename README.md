# Astroviewer
Small example app to showcase my Android dev skills.

Astroviewer allows you to view pictures that the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) web service provides. *Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer*, as they say.

### Tech Highlights

    - Improve Details UI state management :white_check_mark:
    - Visual feedback for button clicks (reconsider ripple effect) :white_check_mark:
    - Simplify naming for various types :white_check_mark:
    - Let users mark pictures as favourite & save favourites locally
    - Create cool animation for "Mark as Favourite" icon
    - Use streams of data (from Room to UI) instead of one-shot requests where possible (observe data instead of requesting it)
    - Fixes for various edge cases 

### Screens
| List Screen                                          | Sort Dialog                                          | Details Screen                                          |
